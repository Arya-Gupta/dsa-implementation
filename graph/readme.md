## Graph Terminology

- **Edges**: The connections between vertices in a graph.

- **Directed graph**: A graph where edges have a direction, going from one vertex to another.

- **Undirected graph**: A graph where edges have no direction and connect two vertices bidirectionally.

- **Bidirectional graph**: A graph where each edge has two directions, connecting two vertices in both directions (essentially an undirected graph).

- **Cycles**: A path in a graph that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating edges.

- **Cyclic graph**: A graph that contains at least one cycle.

- **Acyclic graph**: A graph that does not contain any cycles.

- **Path**: A sequence of edges connecting vertices in a graph, where no node appears more than once, and there is a way to reach from one vertex to another.

- **Degree**: The number of edges connected to a vertex in a graph.
  Total degree of a graph = 2 x E

- For directed graphs,

  - **Indegree**: The number of edges coming into a vertex in a directed graph.
  - **Outdegree**: The number of edges going out from a vertex in a directed graph.

- **Edge weight**: A value assigned to an edge in a graph, representing the cost, distance, or other measure of the connection between two vertices; if not provided, the weight is assumed to be 1.
